gramatyk
========

Python library for producing human (and machine) -friendly definitions, conjugations and declensions for Polish vocab.

-- This is a work in progress, and is not yet ready for general use! --

Gramatyk uses an internal grammar model to predict what a student of Polish would *expect* the conjugation of a verb or declension of a noun to be, and then checks Wiktionary to determine where the actual grammar differs from what you might expect. This enables Gramatyk to quickly point out to a student those forms of a word which need particular attention.

Gramatyk can also produce definitions and example sentences, and can output both human-readable and XML-based data for single words or vocabulary lists.
